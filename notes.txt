Git is distributed version control

   *   not SVN. No dIffs are stored. 
      * Instead every file and tree are hashed and the SHA 1 are stored. Tis makes it fast and efficient
         * Blh blah blah - only the nerds care about this
         Practical example
         Take Joel's zip file. 

         Unzip it
         Cd to directory
         Git init <= this will get the directory ready to be tracked. 

         The normal workflow
         Git add file file file
         Git status
         Git diff --cached
         Git commit (-m if you are lazy)

  Change files
  Git status
  Git add
  Git commit

  Now imagine I wandered to share this with Joel. This would allow him to do the amazingly things that he does.  We are going to use github as out public repo. This will be visible to anyone who want to see / use it

  ***** create repo in github.  Follow directions

  Push changes


  Imgine now that I am on Joel's machine. 

  Git clone
  Have all the file stat I need 

  Add some stuff. Change it.  Update repo. No more file shares!!!


  Git pull 
  Git push


  Git log

  Intermediate commands
